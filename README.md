# C.H.R.I.S. (Computerized Human Readable Instrumental Score)
Guitar hero--but for real, live guitars. 

## Inspiration
Our friend Chris is a pretty epic guitarist. So we made C.H.R.I.S. to help him and guitar players like him practice and play better. 

## What it does
C.H.R.I.S. takes in a guitar tab (as a .txt file) and BPM (integer value) specified by the user, and presents the tab to them as they play through it. The user is then scored on their overall accuracy through the song and has the chance to save this score to a high-score list. 

## How we built it
We used Python to develop C.H.R.I.S.
